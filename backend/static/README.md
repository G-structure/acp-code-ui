Place your Noise XX responder WASM bundle here as `noise_xx_bg.wasm`.

Alternatives:
- Set NOISE_WASM_PATH to an absolute or relative path to your WASM file.
- Or place the file under `frontend/public/noise_xx_bg.wasm` to let Vite serve it directly at `/noise_xx_bg.wasm`.

During development, Vite can also proxy `/noise_xx_bg.wasm` to the backend route if desired.
